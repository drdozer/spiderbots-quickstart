# Spiderbots Quickstart

A minimal mod to add a configurable number of spiderbots to the starting inventory of players.
I wanted this functionality for a pY playthrough, so that I could start with a spiderbot boi without voiding achievements by running console commands.
Limited testing with both vanilla and pY.
